# Integrate the Atar iOS SDK

The guide below will walk you through the steps to integrate the Atar iOS SDK into your app, in order to start showing offers to your users.

## Step 1: Create an account and get your App Key

If you haven't already, create an account on the [Atar Dashboard](https://app.atargrowth.com/). Once you've created an account, you'll be able to create an app and get your App Key from the [settings page](https://app.atargrowth.com/settings).

## Step 2: Add the Atar iOS SDK to your app

The Atar SDK can be accessed via Swift package manager.

### 2.1 Find the package on Swift Package Manager

To add the package via Swift Package Manager

1. Select <b>Your Project</b>
2. Go to the tab <b>Package Dependencies</b>
3. Click the <b>+</b> button
4. Enter the package URL `https://github.com/Atar-Growth/Atar-iOS-SDK`

### 2.1 Add Atar

You should select <b>Atar</b> from the All Sources, and select <i>Up To Next Major Version</i>. Then click <b>Add Package</b>.

### 2.3 Verify that Atar is added as a dependency

You can verify that Atar has been successfully added by:

1. Select <b>Your App Target</b>
2. Go to the <b>General</b> tab
3. Scroll down to <b>Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content</b>
4. Verify that you see <b>Atar</b>

## Step 3: Initialize the Atar SDK

Initialize the Atar SDK in your **AppDelegate** class's **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method.

=== "Swift"
    ``` swift
    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        Atar.getInstance().didFinishLaunching(appKey: "YOUR APP KEY")
        // your other code
        return true
    }
    ```

=== "Objective C"
    ``` objc
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
        [[Atar getInstance] didFinishLaunchingWithAppKey:@"YOUR APP KEY"];
        // your other code
        return YES;
    }
    ```

Replace **YOUR APP KEY** with the App Key you got from the Atar Dashboard.

## Step 4: Show Offers after the user has completed a transaction

Once you've initialized the Atar SDK, you can show offers to your users. Here's an example of how you can show an interstitial offer after the user has completed a transaction.

=== "Java"
    ```java
    OfferRequest request = new OfferRequest(new OfferRequestCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onShown(boolean success, Exception error) {
        if (success) {
            Log.i("AtarTestBed", "Popup shown successfully");
        } else {
            Log.e("AtarTestBed", "Error: " + error.getMessage());
        }
    }
    @Override
    public void onClicked() {
        Log.i("AtarTestBed", "Interstitial was clicked!");
    }
    });

    // Complete the information about the user and transaction
    request.event = "purchase";
    request.userId = "userId1234";
    request.email = "user1234@email.com";
    request.phone = "1234567890";
    // this is some unique referenced ID for the transaction
    request.referenceId = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    request.gender = "M";
    request.dob = "YYYYMMDD";
    request.address1 = "123 Example St";
    request.address2 = "Suite 123";
    request.city = "City";
    request.state = "State";
    request.zip = "12345";
    request.country = "Country";
    request.amount = 29.98;

    Atar.getInstance(this).showOfferPopup(request);
    ```

=== "Kotlin"
    ```kotlin
    val request = OfferRequest(object : OfferRequestCallback {
      override fun onShown(success: Boolean, error: Exception?) {
          if (success) {
              Log.i("AtarTestBed", "Popup shown successfully")
          } else {
              Log.e("AtarTestBed", "Error: " + error?.message)
          }
      }
      override fun onClicked() {
          Log.i("AtarTestBed", "Interstitial was clicked!")
      }
    })

    // Complete the information about the user and transaction
    request.event = "purchase";
    request.userId = "userId1234";
    request.email = "user1234@email.com";
    request.phone = "1234567890";
    // this is some unique referenced ID for the transaction
    request.referenceId = UUID

    .randomUUID().toString(); 
    request.gender = "M";
    request.dob = "YYYYMMDD";
    request.address1 = "123 Example St";
    request.address2 = "Suite 123";
    request.city = "City";
    request.state = "State";
    request.zip = "12345";
    request.country = "Country";
    request.amount = 29.98;

    Atar.getInstance(this).showOfferPopup(request);
    ```

Replace the values in the **OfferRequest** object with the appropriate values for your user and transaction. Below you can find the full documented list of fields you can use in the **OfferRequest** object.

Note that the callback is optional and purely in case you would like to tie any additional functionality to the presentation of the offer.
