# Atar Integration Overview

Welcome to the Atar documentation for apps that plan to showcase offers in their app via messages or notifications. Atar can be integrated through your customer communication platform or via the lightweight SDKs.

## SDK-less integration

- [OneSignal](#) shows how to enable offers with OneSignal.
- [Clevertap](#) shows how to enable offers with Clevertap.
- [Braze](#) shows how to enable offers with Braze.
- [Airship](#) shows how to enable offers with Airship.
- [Moengage](#) shows how to enable offers with Moengage.
- [Customer.io](#) shows how to enable offers with Customer.io.
- [Iterable](#) shows how to enable offers with Iterable.

## SDK integration

To further optimize the integration, you can add Atar's lightweight SDK to your apps:
