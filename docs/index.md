# Atar Integration Overview

Welcome to the Atar documentation for apps that plan to showcase offers in their app via messages or notifications. Atar can be integrated through your customer communication platform or via the lightweight SDKs.

## Over-the-air integration

In order to use the SDK-less integration, you must have one of the following customer communication platforms integrated into your app. Atar sends the offers via these platforms.

- [OneSignal](#) shows how to enable offers with OneSignal - docs provided upon request.
- [Clevertap](#) shows how to enable offers with Clevertap - docs provided upon request.
- [Braze](#) shows how to enable offers with Braze - docs provided upon request.

## Native integration

To further optimize the integration, you can add Atar's lightweight SDK to your apps:
