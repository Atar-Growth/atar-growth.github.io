# Atar Growth Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy and Notice at Collection ("Privacy Policy") explains how Atar Growth, Inc ("Atar Growth", "us", "our", and "we"), collects and uses Personal Information (as defined below) and outlines the basis on which we process the Personal Information we collect from or about you. This document aims to provide concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible information about our data processing practices—please take the time to read it thoroughly.

This Privacy Policy applies to all users of Atar Growth services accessed through atargrowth.com and other associated Atar Growth websites ("Atar Owned Sites"), as well as Atar Growth technology integrated on third-party partner websites, apps, or mobile-device applications ("Partner Sites") (collectively, "Atar Sites"). This Privacy Policy also applies to individuals who interact with Atar Growth in a professional capacity on behalf of their company or employer in transactions with Atar Growth. However, this Privacy Policy does not apply in situations where Atar Growth processes your Personal Information solely on behalf of our Partners to enable them to offer their services directly and not on behalf of other Advertisers. For information on how these Partners use your Personal Information, please consult their respective privacy policies or notices. 

Some of our ads are supplied by Fluent, LLC; for details on their data practices, please see the [Fluent Privacy Policy](https://fluentco.com/privacy-and-cookie-policy/). Additionally, if you are an Atar Growth employee or contractor, or if you apply for a job with Atar Growth, the Personal Information collected in these contexts will be covered under separate privacy policies provided to you as appropriate.

## Atar Services

Atar Growth provides services to companies ("Partners") that allow you to receive offers, promotions, coupons, discounts, app download invitations, and calendar subscription invitations, and to interact with other marketing services (including during or after a transaction) (collectively, "Offers") from third-party advertisers ("Advertisers"), displayed on Atar Sites. Additionally, Atar Growth provides a service called "Gravy Pass" that allows users to earn real cash through engaging with qualifying Offers.

## Your Choices and Their Implications

There is no obligation for you to sign up to Offers. If you choose to engage with any Offers, we may share your Personal Information, where applicable, with the party identified in the Offer, enabling them to fulfill the Offers and provide you with further information related to such Offers, as elaborated below under 'Collection and Use of Personal Information'. Importantly, there are no negative consequences if you choose not to sign up to an Offer, nor will it prevent you from accessing future services from that company—no further action will be taken regarding that Offer.

## SMS Messaging and Consent

Atar Growth may offer the ability to receive SMS messages from us at the phone number (866) 377-1970. If you choose to opt in to SMS communications:

- You provide your express written consent to receive promotional, transactional, and informational text messages from Atar Growth.
- Message frequency may vary depending on your activity and engagement with our services.
- Standard message and data rates may apply.
- You acknowledge that consent is not a condition of purchasing any goods or services.
- You can opt out at any time by texting STOP to (866) 377-1970 or by contacting privacy@atargrowth.com.
- For help, text HELP to (866) 377-1970 or contact support@atargrowth.com.

Your consent to receive SMS messages is separate from any other consents you may have provided. We will never automatically opt you into SMS messaging - this requires your explicit action and consent through our opt-in process. You will have the opportunity to confirm your phone number and consent before receiving marketing messages.

Your privacy is a top priority at Atar Growth. We are committed to safeguarding your personal data and ensuring its confidentiality and security.

Before we transfer your Personal Information to an overseas recipient, we take necessary and reasonable steps to ensure that the recipient complies with privacy laws applicable to your Personal Information.

### Locations of Data Processing

When disclosing your Personal Information to Advertisers and third-party processors, it is likely, though not guaranteed, that these entities will be located in one of the markets where we operate or maintain a presence. This includes the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Japan, the European Union, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and other countries as detailed on our website.

### Data Transfer Mechanisms

For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), Atar Growth takes additional measures when transferring Personal Information outside the EEA:
- To Suppliers and Group Members: We may transfer data to suppliers or other entities within the Atar Growth Group.
- To Advertisers and Partners: When transferring data to Advertisers and Partners outside the EEA.

These transfers are conducted under conditions that are deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection according to the European Commission or involve appropriate safeguards such as:
- Transfer to countries recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate protection.
- Use of standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or binding corporate rules approved by a competent supervisory authority.
- Occasional transfers necessary for the performance of a contract, to protect your vital interests, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

In order to protect the data rights of EU residents when transferring data outside the EU, Atar Growth relies on EU-approved standard contractual clauses as a basis for such transfers, in compliance with Article 47 of the GDPR.

## Security Measures

The security of your Personal Information is a top priority at Atar Growth, especially when it is transferred overseas.

### Implementing Robust Security Measures

We implement rigorous technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Information against loss, misuse, unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. These measures are designed to provide a security level commensurate with the risk associated with processing your Personal Information. However, it's important to acknowledge that no method of transmitting or storing information online is completely secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Specific Security Practices

Our security practices include:

- **Restricting Access:** We limit access to Personal Information wherever practical, ensuring only authorized personnel can view such data.
- **Encryption:** We use industry-standard encryption to protect data both in transit and at rest, safeguarding against unauthorized access.
- **Secure Network:** We maintain a secure network with no direct access between the internet and the systems that process your data, enhancing overall security.
- **Pseudonymization Techniques:** Techniques such as hashing email addresses or device IDs are employed to minimize risks associated with data processing.
- **Regular Security Assessments:** We regularly perform scans and penetration tests on our applications and networks to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- **Third-Party Security Requirements:** We demand that any third parties with whom we conduct business uphold equivalent security and confidentiality measures to protect data integrity.

These precautions are part of our commitment to ensuring the security of your Personal Information and maintaining your trust in our practices.

## Retention of Personal Information

Atar Growth determines the retention periods for Personal Information in consultation with our Partners and Advertisers, considering several factors including legal requirements and business needs. Our retention policies ensure that Personal Information is kept only as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, subject to your rights as a data subject and our requirements to defend legal claims or maintain legitimate business operations.

We determine that Personal Information should be retained in the following ways:

- Consultation with Partners: We set data retention periods in consultation with our Partners and Advertisers, based on the need to retain the data to fulfill contractual obligations, provide services, and support marketing efforts.
- Legal and Business Requirements: Retention periods may vary depending on local laws and market practices. These periods are also influenced by the necessity to hold data for periods required to establish, exercise, or defend legal rights or for ongoing legitimate business interests, such as proving that you consented to a particular Offer or communication.

We rely on the following criteria to determine appropriate retention periods:

- Necessity for Service Provision: The need for the Personal Information to fulfill our services to Partners and Advertisers.
- Sensitivity of the Information: The types and sensitivity of the Personal Information being processed.
- Regulatory Requirements: Compliance with relevant laws and regulations affecting data retention, including those related to tax, employment, accounting, and securities.
- Legal Claims: Consideration of whether the Personal Information might be relevant to potential legal claims.

### Responsibility of Partners and Advertisers

Atar Growth is not responsible for the retention practices of our Partners and Advertisers. You should consult the privacy policies of the Partners and Advertisers with whom you interact to understand how they manage the Personal Information they collect and retain.

For more details on how you can exercise your rights concerning your Personal Information, please refer to the 'Your Rights in Relation to Your Personal Information' section.

## Use of Tracking Technologies

Like many companies, Atar Growth employs various Tracking Technologies when displaying online Offers. These technologies include cookies, entity tags (eTags), pixels, web beacons/GIFs, local storage, and other identifiers that may be used on your device and browser settings. 

Their purpose is to recognize you and your device each time we display Offers, enhancing your user experience in the following ways:

- Recognition and Personalization: We apply statistical probabilities to data sets, which help us recognize or make assumptions about users and devices, such as identifying a user across multiple devices.
- Configuration Changes: Tracking Technologies may alter settings or configurations on your device. We use both session and persistent Tracking Technologies to maintain and enhance user interaction with our services.
- Enhanced Online Experience: These technologies are used for various purposes, including setting preferences, selecting tailored Offers, performing analytics, attributing conversions, and reducing fraud.

Rejecting the use of Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer see advertisements when you visit Atar Sites. However, the ads you see may be less tailored to your interests. You have the right to reject the use of Tracking Technologies. Detailed information about how these technologies are used and how you can exercise your rights is available in our 'Cookies' Policy.

## Exclusions

At Atar Growth, when we provide your Personal Information to a third-party, such as an Advertiser or Partner in relation to an Offer, it is important to understand that this information will be managed according to that third party's own privacy policy, not Atar Growth's. We recommend that you consult the privacy policies of our Advertisers and Partners for more details on their handling, use, disclosure, transmission, or storage of your Personal Information.

This policy does not cover the practices of companies that Atar Growth does not own or control, or to individuals that are not employed or managed by Atar Growth, even if Offers, coupons, or links to their websites may appear within our services.

As a provider of marketing technology, Atar Growth does not endorse any specific Partners or Advertisers, nor do we assume any responsibility for completing or finalizing Offers on their behalf. We provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive information about Offers that interest you, without taking your specific personal circumstances into account.

## Your Privacy Rights

At Atar Growth, applicable laws may provide you with numerous rights regarding the processing of your Personal Information. These rights include:

- Access and Information Rights: You have the right to request access to or copies of your Personal Information that we process or control, along with detailed information about the nature, processing, and disclosure of that Personal Information.

Once you opt out, you will receive a confirmation message, and we will no longer send you SMS messages.
